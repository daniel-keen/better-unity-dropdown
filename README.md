<h1 align="middle">Better Unity Dropdown by Daniel Keen</h1>
<p align="middle">This is a better version of Unity Dropdown component.</p>

## Installation
Install via UPM:
```
https://github.com/daniel-keen/better-unity-dropdown.git?path=Assets/BetterUnityDropdown
```

## How to use:
This asset replaces the default UI dropdown and allows for full customization, including options style and animations. It is designed to work seamlessly with TMP_InputField, and it is highly recommended to use TMP text and InputField for the best experience. However, it can be easily switched to the default Unity components if needed.

## Usage:
- The included scene demonstrates four dropdowns with different animations:
- In the Prefabs folder, you will find the dropdown prefab which can be dragged into the canvas.
- Each dropdown contains an OptionsObject where you can customize the options style.

All settings and methods are thoroughly documented in the scripts. Each variable and method includes a description, and the code is fully commented, ensuring that the dropdown is fully customizable.
